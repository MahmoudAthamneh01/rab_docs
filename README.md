## I purchased React App Builder. What should I do next.

Thanks for the purchase. 

React App Builder, consist of two parts

1. **WEB PLATFORM** \( web site where your users make the apps \)
2. **APP PRODUCER** \( the process of compiling/building the apps \)

  
First, you need to install the WEB PLATFORM.
