# App Producer is stuck on single app

Sometimes, the app producer can be stuck on a single app if users enter incorrect data. 

In order to reset the list of submitted apps, run **rabinstaller** in your VSCode terminal and select **Management**. 

Then select the option to clear the list of apps to be made.
