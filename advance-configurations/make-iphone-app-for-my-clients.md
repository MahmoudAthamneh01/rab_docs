# Make iPhone App for my Clients

The process of making an iPhone app is not fully automated. 

At the moment there is no way to fully automated the process of uploading and submitting an iPhone app to Apple for your clients. 

The communication with your client will start when they send you their project files. Explained [here](https://mobidonia.gitbook.io/appmaker-docs/publishing-and-updating/submit-app-for-creation). 

You or your clients should have an [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/) \( 99$/year\)

**Your job will be to**

1. Build the app
2. Upload app
3. Take screenshots
4. Upload screenshots
5. Submit app for review



#### Build the App <a id="build-the-app"></a>

Your client should send you an email with the app ID. 

Run your [Local App producer](https://mobidonia.gitbook.io/react-app-builder/setup-and-deploy-the-project/run-app-producer-locally). 

Instead of selecting the "Start build cycle" select, **iPhone App** and then select **Build**.

And enter the id of the app of your client.



#### Upload app <a id="upload-app"></a>

Next, run **rab-&gt;Run App producer locally-&gt;iPhone App** and then select **Upload**

This script will as you question how you want to publish the iPhone app, on what account. Do this in collaboration with your client. 

Create a new app in your iTunes connect portal.



#### Take screenshots <a id="take-screenshots"></a>

Next, run **rab-&gt;Run App producer locally-&gt;iPhone App** and then select **Screenshots**

This will open a web browser. Run-on different  Simulators to take the screenshots.



#### Upload screenshots <a id="upload-screenshots"></a>

Upload the screenshot in iTunes Connect. Check different requirements.

#### Submit the app for review.  <a id="submit-the-app-for-review"></a>

After you have put all the descriptions, and screenshots you will be able to submit the app for review.
