# Getting Started

## Why we offer Cloud React App Builder

Although React App Builder has documentation for installation and it is pretty straightforward, sometimes just maintaining and updating the project / server is difficult and time consuming. Then when they have an iOS app to make, they will need to make it manually and spent time on it.

We wanted to offer our clients fully managed service, where their only job will be to market their project and earn money from it.

With Cloud React App Builder you get your instance up and running in 1 business day. Each update to our code is automatically published on the client instance too. No worries for additional server or database costs. No worries for making apps, we handle everything.
