# Setup project config file

You should already do all the requirements needed, so now you should have

1. Firebase account 
2. Expo account
3. SMTP account
4. TinyMCE account
5. Paddle Account

Now, unzip the zip file that you got from CodeCanyon. 

Open the folder with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
