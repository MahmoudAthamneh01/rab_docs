# Setup project config file

You should already do all the requirements needed, so now you should have

1. Firebase account 
2. Expo account
3. SMTP account
4. TinyMCE account
5. Paddle Account

Now, unzip the zip file that you got from CodeCanyon. 

Open the folder with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

In the file structure, locate **project\_config.json**. 

Fill all the empty fields. In the end, your file should look filled, like this one.

You can find the **purchaseCode** in [CodeCanyon Download Page](https://codecanyon.net/downloads?utf8=%E2%9C%93&filter_by=codecanyon.net&sort_by=Date+Purchased&order=desc&page=1).
