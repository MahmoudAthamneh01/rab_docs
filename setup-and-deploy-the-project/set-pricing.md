# Set pricing

In Visual Studio Code's terminal run **rabinstaller**.

From the menu, select the "Set Pricing".

This action will upload/set your pricing plan that you will offer to your clients. 

For on-fly changes on the pricing, you can do them from the app builder page -&gt; settings. 

This is to just initially create your pricing plan. 

You as an admin will be able to make apps free.
